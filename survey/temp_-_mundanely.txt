The act of having superpowers seems unlikely and incompressible to understand. One could simply not wield half the superpowers of this whimsical world. To pick a superpower of my choosing is such an honor to be apart of. Picking a superpower is such an intensive process to partake in and a struggle to deal with. Time travels seems like an optimal conclusive phenomenon that is seemingly unexplainable and unexplored in todays world. For those reasons alone I may likely choose that outcome especially when you view the benefits that come with it. Benefits over the possessive possessions of the world are to be graciously held and not to be taken lightly or for granted. This world is a treasure to be derived from questions such as this so I thank you for the opportunity.
